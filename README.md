# Pi-Stoplight-Over-Wifi
The code and images for my WiFi stoplight project for my IOT Class

This project is meant to be run as a webserver on a raspberry pi.  It uses python Flask to produce the web server.  I chose Python Flask because it made it a lot easier for me to execute the python GPIO scripts.

To run enseure you have python 3 installed. Then simply run
```
python3 app.py
```
